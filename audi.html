        <h1> This is the story of Audi</h1>
        <p class="mercedesecontent">
            AUDI AG is able to look back on an exciting and varied past – its tradition of car and engine manufacturing
            extends back into the 19th century. It all began with August Horch, one of Germany's pioneering
            personalities automobile engineers. After graduating from the Technical Academy in Mittweida, Saxony he
            worked on engine construction and later as head of the motor vehicle production department of the Carl Benz
            company in Mannheim. In 1899 he started his own business A.Horch & Cie. in Cologne. Horch moved to Saxony in
            1902, first to Reichenbach then in 1904 to Zwickau, where the company was transformed into a joint-stock
            corporation. <br> <br>

            From Horch to Audi <br>

            Following differences of opinion with the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, August Horch left the
            company in 1909 and immediately established a second car company in Zwickau. Because his surname was already
            in use and was protected by trademark, he chose its Latin translation for the new company. So "horch!" or
            "hark" became "audi!". The idea of using the Latin imperative form came from the son of one of August
            Horch's business partners; the boy, well-versed in Latin, had overheard the discussion about the search for
            a new company name. In subsequent correspondence, August Horch even signed his letters with the words "Kind
            regards Audi-Horch". Audi Automobilwerke GmbH itself became a joint-stock company in December 1914.
            <br> <br>
            At the end of 1945, leading employees of the Auto Union in the old garrison town of Ingolstadt set up a
            depot for Auto Union spare parts. On September 3, 1949, this led to the formation of Auto Union GmbH, an
            independent manufacturing company that was released from its former ties. Later that same year, work began
            on the manufacture of delivery vans and motorcycles.
            <br>


            In the early stages, it was the tried-and-tested DKW products with their two-stroke engines that were built
            once more under the sign of the four rings. During the period of deprivation in the years following the war,
            there was a need for robust and reliable cars and motorbikes. As a result, models such as the DKW F 89 L
            delivery van and the DKW RT 125 W motorbike were developed. They were produced by the vehicle manufacturing
            plant in Ingolstadt. At the same time, work was underway on a DKW passenger car, which was eventually
            produced in the summer of 1950 in a second new plant in Düsseldorf that used to belong to Rheinmetall AG and
            was merely leased at first.
            <br>


            From 1954 onwards, Friedrich Flick gradually acquired a large stake in the equity of Auto Union GmbH. His
            strategy was to find a strong partner for Auto Union in the medium term. In April 1958, Daimler-Benz AG
            acquired 88 percent of Auto Union's shares and in the following year the Ingolstadt company became a
            fully-owned subsidiary.
